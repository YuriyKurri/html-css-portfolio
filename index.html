      <p>Well blow me down? If ye thinks he be ready to sail a beauty, ye better be willin’ to sink with her. The Code is more like guidelines, really. “Yes, I do heartily repent. I repent I had not done more mischief; and that we did not cut the throats of them that took us, and I am extremely sorry that you aren’t hanged as well as we. ” Pirate’s code: First freedom and the captain. Second the loot, third woman and the rum and at the end no mercy if they not immediately surrender! Well actualy piracy is a democracy with captains voted for by the crew. Whats a pirate’s favorite fast food restaurant? Arrrrbys! Arrrrrrrr Piracy – Hostile take over.

Yarrrr! there be ony two ranks of leader amongst us pirates! Captain and if your really notorious then it’s Cap’n! Why is the rum gone? Arrrrrrrr My mom would not let me see the pirate movie because it was rated rrrrr. Why is the rum gone? Now and then we had a hope that if we lived and were good, God would permit us to be pirates.
